# :currency_exchange: Simple-Currency-Converter

Sometimes there is a need to convert one currency into another. 

Let's say you are going to Japan for a holiday.  Their currency used is the Japanese yen, but you get paid in dollars.

To be able to book hotel rooms, go shopping and visit the sights, you will obviously need local money.

This program will help you with this task.

## How to use it?

1. Download the 'Simple_Currency_Converter.js' file.

2. To make use of the 'sync-input' library, follow [the instructions](https://github.com/hyperskill/sync-input#installation).

3. Run the file.

   To know the exact amount of money you will get after the exchanging, you need to know the currency exchange rate.
   So, the first thing you'll be shown is a list of all available currencies and their rates against 1 dollar.
   
   To start the conversion, input "1" and specify the initial and target currencies, as well as the amount of money you would like to exchange.
   
   Once you are done, exit the program by entering '2'.
